<!-- # README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

<!-- 1. The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username (a proper authenticated login is **not** a requirement).
2. The user is presented with a profile page (see the *User profile page* screenshot above) that includes links to:
    1. "All my transactions".
    2. "All my external transactions".
    3. "All groups".
3. When user opens "All my transactions" page (see the *Transactions list page* screenshot above):
    1. Total amount is displayed at the top (in place of "Gift credit" at the design).
    2. A list of all transactions created by logged-in user is displayed (sorted by most recent).
    3. Each transaction displays its name, amount and date, and an icon of the first group it has been assigned to.
    4. An action button "Add new" is displayed.
4. When user opens "All my external transactions" page (see the *Transactions list page* screenshot above):
    1. A list of all transactions that are created by a logged-in user but **not assigned to any group** (sorted by most recent).
    2. The design of the page is similar to the "All my transactions".
5. When user opens "All groups" page:
    1. A list of all groups is displayed (example ideas for names: "Kitchen renovation", "Books, music & culture", "Car maintenance") in alphabetical order.
    2. Each group displays its icon, name and creation date.
    3. Each group is clickable and opens "Group transactions" page.
    4. An action button "Create new" is displayed.
    5. The design of the page is similar to the "User profile page"
6. When user opens the "Group transactions" page:
    1. A list of all transactions that belong to that group is displayed.
    2. The design of the page is similar to the "All my transactions". Besides the information that appears in All my transactions page, each transaction displays the **name of the author** of the transaction.
7. When user opens "Create new group" or "Add new transaction" page:
    1. A form with all necessary fields is displayed.
    2. It's not in the given design, but you should make an effort to follow the same style of the other pages.
8. At the end extend your MVP app with one simple feature of your choice.

You should follow the guidelines of the given design, including:

- colors (they are not explicit, you should pick them from design)
- typographies: font face, size and weight (use similar ones to the design)
- layout: composition and space between elements

While developing the project, you should follow the best practices that you already learned in the previous projects, like setting-up a code linter, using gitflow, testing business logic, writing good commit messages and an informative README.

You can access all the design info (color, typography, layouts) in this link:
