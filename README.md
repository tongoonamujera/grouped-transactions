# GROUP OUR TRANSACTIONS

> In this project, I will build an application that allows users to create their own transaction lists. In this application, users can also create groups with which they can add their transactions. See live demo........

## Live Demo Link

[groupedtransactions](https://groupedtransactions.herokuapp.com)

## Built With

- Ruby(3.0.0p0)
- Ruby on Rails(6.0.4.1)
- Bulma
- Fontawesome icons
- Postgresql
- hmtl5
- sass

## Getting Started

Clone

```git
git clone https://github.com/tongoonamujera/grouped-transactions.git
```

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

1. Open a terminal window and enter `git clone https://github.com/tongoonamujera/grouped-transactions.git`
2. Make your new cloned directory your active directory
3. Currently, you are in the "development branch."
4. Change your current branch to Feature branch `git checkout feature`
5. Run `bundle` to install gems to your project

### USAGE

- In this application users can create:

  - Thier own transactions

  - Their own groups

  - Assign transactions to groups

- User will be able to see a list of created transactions and their total

- User will be able to see a list of all groups sorted in alphabetical order

- User will be able to see transation that belongs to a group and total amount of transactions pertaining to that group

- User will be able to see all his external transactions (ie. transactions that are not assigned to any group) and their total

- ## Extra feature Added

  - I Add an extra feature that allows users to archieve thier own payments or transactions

    - This feature barely allow a user to archieve his or her own transaction and hence there will de reduction in his total amount.

    - Archieved transaction won't appear to groups.

    - Archieved transactions show thier total amount.

    - Archieved transaction can also be reversed if only user thinks about reversing them.

    - User can only see his list of archieved transactions
